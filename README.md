## Newsgroup Classification project using BERT and CI-CD pipelines

This is an end-to-end production-grade machine learning project using BERT Classifier, GitHub Actions, Flask Framework, Docker, and AWS Deployment. I have used the 20 Newsgroup Dataset from Kaggle which is a multi-class classification problem. I have fine-tuned a DistilBERT model classify the text files data among the 20 different newsgroups. And finally created predict pipelines to deploy the Flask application on the AWS EC2 instance using docker and GitHuB Actions.
